"""Core computational modules for CellType-Refinery.

This package contains the main analysis engines:
- preprocessing: Data loading, QC, normalization, alignment, batch correction
- clustering: Leiden clustering and subclustering
- annotation: Marker-based cell-type annotation
- refinement: Iterative annotation refinement
- diagnosis: Diagnostic reports for refinement decisions
- consolidation: Final label assignment
- composition: Cell-type composition statistics
- spatial: Spatial analysis (neighborhood enrichment, Moran's I)
- review: QC flagging and validation
